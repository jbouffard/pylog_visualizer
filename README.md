This is a simple python script that will create and save a graph showing
the time it takes to read in various GeoTiff segments.

To use this script, simply pass in either the file or directory which
is/contains the csv file(s) you want to be read in as the first
parameter. The second paramter is either the file path (including the
name) where the resulting graph should be saved.

```python
  python pylog_visualizer.py "paht/to/my/csv.csv" "path/to/save.png"
```
